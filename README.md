# My website

This is my website. Originally started on GitHub, and now transferred to GitLab. It is a collection of random things I'm working on, scripts I've written, or projects I've open sourced.

# Cloning

Make sure you get the theme by cloning submodules:

```bash
git submodules update --init --recursive
```
