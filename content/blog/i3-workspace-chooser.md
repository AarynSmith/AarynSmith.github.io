After working with I3 I've got a few window layouts I like for various tasks.
<!--more-->

This script is available on my [Github](https://github.com/AarynSmith/I3-Workspace-Chooser).

I'm a creature of habit, and I like to have my window layouts in a consistent layout. I have one layout for working on this blog, two columns. The first column has VIM, a free terminal, and hugo server, and the second column is a browser window showing a preview of my blog as I update it. Another layout I've been using while writing the [Project Euler](/tags/euler/) posts, which is similar to the blog layout, but one less terminal window on the left, and all of the terminals are pointed to a different directory.

![Screenshot](/img/I3-Workspace-Chooser-Screenshot.png)_Here you can see my blogging layout, as well as my Workspace chooser._

I'm already using [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi) for a program launcher, so I wanted to use it's dmenu replacement mode to display a list of predefined workspaces, and run a script based on the selection.

Now, when I want to setup a new workspace, I can open each of the windows I want and arrange them to my liking, then use [i3-save-tree](https://i3wm.org/docs/layout-saving.html) to save the layout to a JSON file and modifying it , then I create a shell script with a series of i3-msg commands to launch various programs. The issue I ran into however was I wanted the terminals to open in specific directories, and run a program, but then to remain open after the program (i.e. VIM) had closed. In order to accomplish this I had to add a small tweak to my shell's rc file.

```bash
if [[ $1 == eval ]]
then
    "$@"
fi
```

This snippet tells your shell that if the first argument is `eval`, to execute the following arguments. This allowed me to build up a command in my workspace shell script below to start a program in a specific target directory.

```bash
i3-msg 'workspace WorkSpaceName; exec "i3-sensible-terminal -e zsh -is eval cd ~/Target_Directory/\; programName"'
```

This runs `i3-msg` telling it the workspace context (WorkSpaceName), and telling i3 to execute a command. The command being executed is `i3-sensible-terminal` which launches my terminal `urxvt` with the `-e` option, which runs another command. That command is my shell `zsh` with the `-i` and `-s` options. The `-i` option forces the shell to be interactive, and the `-s` reads the input from the command line. The command being run is `eval` which the snippet from above tells the shell to execute the following arguments, in this case a `cd` to a directory and then a program name.

This combined with the `i3-msg` append_layout command to restore a `i3-save-tree` JSON layout to a workspace can give us the ability to restore a complete workspace. So I wrote a script that will look for the JSON layout files, format them for rofi, then execute the associated shell script with the layout chosen.

```bash
shopt -s extglob
declare -A dmenu
WS_DIR=~/Scripts/Workspaces/
for file in ${WS_DIR}*.json
do
    dmenu+=([`basename ${file}`]=${file})
done
workspace=$(echo "$(printf "%s\n" "${!dmenu[@]}")" | rofi -i -dmenu)

if [ ! -z "$workspace" ];
then
    scriptname="${WS_DIR}$(basename ${dmenu[${workspace}]} .json).sh"
    exec sh ${scriptname}
fi
```

This combined with your JSON and shell script files will show you a rofi menu, allowing you to select the workspace you want to launch, then launch the layout on the workspace defined in the shell script. Below is a sample JSON and shell script that will launch two terminals, one running vim and one open and a web browser on workspace 9. You will notice in the shell scripts, a short sleep between opening similar windows (i.e. two terminals). This is to prevent the terminals from opening in the wrong order.
