My name is Aaryn Smith, and I am a software developer in Texas. I write primarily in Go, and Python. I started programing in middle school by teaching myself Perl, by reading the [Perl Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596003135.do). I went on to teach myself JavaScript, C, C++, Ruby, Python, and most recently Go. I have done work with COBOL (yes that COBOL), Docker, Docker-Compose, Embedded Systems (ESP-32 and ESP8266).

I love facing a new challenge and finding new and creative ways to overcome it.

My first open source project is [ztDNS](https://github.com/uxbh/ztdns), a DNS server for use on a [ZeroTier](https://zerotier.com/) network (or networks). It integrates with the ZeroTier REST API in order to pull device names from your network configuration to serve as A and AAAA DNS records.
