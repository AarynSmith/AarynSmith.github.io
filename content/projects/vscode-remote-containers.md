Recently I've been creating devcontainer configurations for VSCode's Remote Containers extension. The main repository for this project is [https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers).

Below is a list of the containers I've worked on or created:

* Hugo - Static site generator. [Stand Alone Repo](https://github.com/AarynSmith/vscode-dev-container-hugo/), [Official Repo](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/master/containers/hugo)
* Bash - Shell scripting and debugging. [Stand Alone Repo](https://github.com/AarynSmith/vscode-dev-container-bash/), [Official Repo](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/master/containers/bash)
* Vue - Javascript framework. [Stand Alone Repo](https://github.com/AarynSmith/vscode-dev-container-vue/), [Official Repo](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/master/containers/vue)
